# Revision log

Each round is one change plus a check (a test, or a screenshot reviewed).

## Features
| # | Change | Check |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | `.env` file next to the app file is loaded, real environment wins | unit test |
| F2 | Provider calls retry transient errors (429, 5xx, unreachable) with backoff, never retry auth errors | unit test |
| F3 | Per-owner rate limit on ask and regenerate | code review |
| F4 | Export a whole chat as Markdown (`/api/export`) | unit test |

## UI and UX
| # | Change | Check |
|---|---|---|
| U1 | Safe markdown in answers (bold, code, lists, headings), no innerHTML | screenshot |
| U2 | Copy button on each answer | screenshot |
| U3 | Export button in the title bar | screenshot |
| U4 | Mock answers cut at a word, not mid-word | screenshot |

## Batch 2
| # | Change | Check |
|---|---|---|
| F5 | `schema/chat-app.schema.json` for editor autocomplete and validation; a test keeps it in step with the loader | unit test |
| F6 | Lint pass over Custom-Nerd (`pyflakes`): no functional bugs found statically, only unused imports and variables in main.py and helper_functions.py. Runtime bug hunt needs its dependencies and is still open | static check |

## Batch 3
| # | Change | Check |
|---|---|---|
| F7 | Streaming answers: `/api/ask-stream` (NDJSON), real token streaming for Ollama and OpenAI, word streaming for mock | unit + HTTP test, browser run |
| F8 | `app.theme: auto, light, dark` | unit test |
| F9 | Mock provider ignores earlier-turn text, parses only the evidence block | browser run |
| U5 | Answers appear as they stream, thinking dots until first token | browser run |
| U6 | Skip link, labelled conversation log region (screen readers) | markup review |
| U7 | Forced light or dark theme through CSS variables | unit test |
